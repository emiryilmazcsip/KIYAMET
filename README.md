KIYAMET Demo - DOOM PS2 WIP


THIS IS NOT THE GAME. THIS IS A SCRIPT BREAKDOWN AND SHOWCASE.
THE GAME IS DOWNLOADABLE ON https://emiryilmazcsip.itch.io/kiyamet

**THIS IS ONLY A DEMO OF AN IDEA - THERE IS ONLY ONE LAYER/LEVEL**

You are a Reverend. Your name is DOOM. Human life has resided on Mars ever since Satan has taken over Earth. Satan has made Earth into different layers. The nine layers of hell. You currently have landed into the first layer. Limbo. Make your way through all of the layers to defeat Satan and reclaim the Earth.

You are the only hope we have...Reverend DOOM.



*INSTRUCTIONS MESSAGE INCOMING*

REVEREND DOOM,

SATAN HAS BROKEN HIS CONTRACT WITH GOD AND HAS STAGED A TOTAL

DOMINATION OF HUMANS.

THE DEVILS HAVE TAKEN OVER OUR BELOVED PLANET.

THEY HAVE MADE THE EARTH THEIR HOME TO THE NINE LAYERS OF HELL.

THIS IS LAYER ONE. LIMBO.

THIS IS THE FIRST LAYER OF HELL. WHICH IS WHY IT LOOKS LIKE A

SHOWY DAY ON EARTH.

BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING, DON'T TRUST ANYTHING HERE.

EACH LAYER SUCH AS LIMBO IS POWERED BY THREE KEYCARDS OF BALANCE.

THE DEVILS HAVE STOLEN THEN UNDER THE INSTRUCTION OF SATAN.

THEY EACH HOLD PROPHETS THAT BALANCE HEAVEN AND HELL.

THEY NOT ONLY WILL UNLOCK FURTHER AREAS OF LIMBO BUT WILL ALSO SERVE AS WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMPLETELY DESTROY A LAYER.

LIKE LIMBO.

THERE ARE PENTAGRAMS LOCATED NEAR THE LOCATION OF EACH KEYCARD.

THEY ARE COLOREDï¼š

- GREEN

- BLUE 

- RED

YOU NEED ALL THREE

KEYCARDS TO LEAVE. 

THERE SHOULD BE A POINT OF ESCAPE PARKED PAST THE RED DOOR.

THE DEVILS ARE STRONG AND THERE ARE MANY. BUT WE BELIEVE IN YOU.

YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE, YOUR BRAIN. THEY HAVE NEVER TOUCHED SNOW AND ICE - THEY SLIP WHILE CHASING.

USE YOUR MOVEMENT TO AVOID THEM. OR KILL THEM....

WE HAVE GIVEN PLENTY OF AMMUNITION TO DO 50.

WE WILL PRAY FOR YOU. YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE REVEREND DOOM.



This project is a little game I created for a final project in college. It is one of my first games ever created with C#. I plan to keep on updating it as I gain further knowledge of coding and Unity Editor. I am also looking for 3D Models people can make for me and artwork and basically everything.
